// Cortad on your own machine. Run from your repository's root with the code the connect screen
// showed:
//   npx cortad ABCD2345 -- <how you start your app>      your command, run here with Cortad's hook inside it
//   npx cortad ABCD2345 --port 3000                      an app already running: its replies are seen, its model calls are not
//
// What it does: signs in with the code, uploads your source files once (never .env, never
// node_modules) so your code can be read, runs your start command as you typed it with nothing
// added but the hook, then holds one outbound connection open and does what a run asks: a request to
// your app, a file read, a shell line. It guesses nothing about your environment: your command
// decides the settings, the databases and the services, and nothing is copied or started beside it. The shell is locked by the operating system (lib/lock.mjs) and cannot write your code;
// nothing here writes your files at all. It also makes Cortad known to the coding agents on this
// machine (lib/register.mjs): an MCP entry and a skill, so `npx cortad mcp` answers them from then
// on with the key this connect leaves in ~/.cortad. Nothing here touches git. Your environment
// never leaves this machine. Ctrl-C ends everything.
